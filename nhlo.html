        NHLO created a fantastic technology that makes objects virtually weightless. As this is not a claim easily supported nor explained, we created an animation to give this claim the necessary weight.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal was to make the technology look and sound believable, without giving away exactly how it worked. One way of proving it worked would be to show a real life application, but one of the strong suits of NHLO's technology is its versatility. Animation seemed the more suitable medium to show that off, and also lent itself pretty for a schematic explanation of the technology. Combined with a friendly female voice and a futuristic soundtrack, the animation proved to be a valuable conversation starter for potential partners and investors.
