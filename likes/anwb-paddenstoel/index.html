                How it started
            </h2>
            <p>
                In 1919, the Algemene Nederlandsche Wielrijders Bond (Royal Dutch Touring Club) put the first of many ‚Äúpaddenstoelen‚Äù (mushrooms) along a bike path in the Netherlands. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time there were about a million bicycles in the Netherlands‚Äîor roughly 14 bikes for every 100 citizens. The Dutch cycling culture was starting to take off.
            </p>

            <h2>The rationale</h2>
            <p>
                Existing signposts were made out of steel, which was scarce and expensive after World War I. In addition, the ANWB felt that the existing, man-high signposts were an eyesore, so they asked board member and architect J.W.H. Leliman to come up with a new design in concrete.

            <h2>
                Why I like it
            </h2>
            <p>
                Barring a few iterations and revisions, The rationale balance of out of sight but still useful has withstood the test of time. That in itself is impressive. It‚Äôs kind of brutalist but due to its size also feels friendly (or maybe that‚Äôs due to the mushroom üçÑ¬†connotation, or the fact that it‚Äôs helping people find their way, as opposed to the looming big brutalist architecture of yore (tu Delft aula).
            </p>
            <p>
                And because it looks different, it‚Äôs become a somewhat iconic (but subtle) piece of the Dutch landscape. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You could argue that the low positioning makes it hard to read the signage. But I think it‚Äôs actually a strength of the design. Cyclists can put their feet on it, use it as a steuntje when they looks where to go. It‚Äôs n that sense it kind of becomes a rustpunt in a cycling trip: ok where should I go next, let me lean upon this thing and think about it. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Which is am exactly what happened and why the design. Changed post ww2 but that change was nog ggo‚Äôs so after going back to the metal cap today it‚Äôs a nice polyester hood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Four sides cover all directions twice. Except for when a crossing has more than four splits but how often does that happen?
