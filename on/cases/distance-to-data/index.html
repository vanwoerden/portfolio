                Our entries were getting long. We had a lot of elements we thought were important, and moving them to the top and emphasizing them were the main two ways to reflect that importance. But if everything's important, nothing is. We saw user feedback coming in that our entries were long and that it was hard to find a quick overview of the most important things. On desktop, no data was visible on the first screen. On mobile, the distance to data was more than 2 screens! For a website called our world in data, that's not great.

            <p>
                We were dreaming about being able to use live data in our writing, but that was technically challenging to get right. Consider the following sentence:
            
                <span class="code">In 2000, the UK emitted 2.45 tons of coal per capita.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                When the underlying data changes, we could automatically update this to:
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="code">In <b>2010</b>, the UK emitted <b>1.86</b> tons of coal per capita.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Now imagine we add some context, for example: 
            
                <span class="code">In 2000, the UK emitted 2.45 tons of coal per capita—<i>0.59 tons more than China.</i></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our automatic update becomes tricky when China's emissions surpass those of the UK in 2004; a phrase like <span class="code"><i>that's very close to China</i></span> makes more sense for 2003, and after that it should be <span class="code"><i>less than China.</i></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                And since (global) progress is all about changes over time, not being able to add this contextual layer to the writing would in many cases only be a partial solution for our authors. Big problems require a long-term view, looking at changes over years, decades, sometimes centuries, and organizations publishing data on these problems often do so only once a year.

                Ultimately, the goal behind these changes is to get data closer to everyone who's interested in it and especially to people who can use it to make decisions that affect real long-term progress. These are only two examples of how we aim to accomplish this goal. My role is often to ask why a few times when new ideas come up amongst the founders, so we go from "let's build a super powerful and flexible data analysis tool" to the goal behind that and then suggesting that perhaps a more efficient way to reach that goal is to make our data or visualization tools more easily available inside of existing tools and platforms out there like Jupyter notebooks or Observable, or having our data show up directly on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+vaccinations" target="_blank">Google's SERPs</a>.
