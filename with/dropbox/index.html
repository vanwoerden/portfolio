                        At Our World in Data, we serve many different types of users. From people who don't read and interact with charts every day, to journalists who embed our charts, teachers who use our material in their lectures, policy workers and business people who use our data to present insights to their executives, all the way to researchers and data scientists who download our data to perform their own detailed analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a small team—the total org is under 20 people—and with this amount of variability in use cases, we're forced to prioritize    aggressively and operate as lean as possible to get quick answers about new ideas and improvements to our existing work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, we're focused on long term global progress, and thus take a long view when it comes to product development as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To me, the more uncertain the idea, the more questions that need to be answered. It's just a matter of picking up the right set of tools from the toolbox. I use any combination of interviews, quick experiments, prototypes, analytics, subject matter experts, previous research, competitor examples, and so on, in an incremental fashion. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ideally the findings can then be fed back into a model of the user, the market, and/or the business, so we don't have to start from scratch next time.

                    <p>
                        Communicating clearly and convincingly is an essential skill for any designer, and even more so in remote setting with a lot of asynchronous communication.

                        I've always been drawn to fiction and stories. I love how Neil Gaiman puts it, using Little Red Riding Hood: fiction uses a lie (a wolf pretending to be a grandmother) to tell you the truth (stranger danger).

                    <p>
                        So now I'm reading Stephen King's <i>On Writing</i>, and watching Neil Gaiman and James Patterson on Masterclass to learn more about writing well, and I recently wrote about how <a class="green" href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-horror-of-usability-testing-1e74713dffaa" target="_blank">horror and usability testing are eerily similar</a>.

                        I like picking up new skills and tools. When I wanted to figure out whether the air quality in Beijing was getting better over the long term, I learned just enough about D3.js to build a <a class="blue" href="https://aqi.fyi/beijing" target="_blank">visualization</a> (work in progress) that looked and worked close to the way I wanted it to.

                        <li>
                            Where I am now, I'm the only designer (and product manager). That means I work on a lot of different things. A principal design role would let me focus on design and still give me the ability to work on big picture ideas and detailed solutions. It seems like a natural fit for where I want to go.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What I'm currently missing, and what I think Cerebral could offer, is a team with more design peers and veterans. A team in which I could spread myself a little less thin, while still having a fair amount of impact and authority. A place where I could learn from, collaborate with, and help other designers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Making a difference in peoples' lives gets me excited. It was a key reason for me to join Our World in Data, and Gather Health before that. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For the past year and change, I've been part of a fully remote team, and it's been a breath of fresh air. I've done remote before—in fact, my <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A6cbfc59d-c29c-46e5-a705-465f71f9c310" target="_blank">master's thesis</a> explored remote collaboration—and I've always appreciated the ample amount of heads-down-get-the-work-done time, and that bit of extra flexibility. There are challenges, but I really like that as a remote team, you're forced to be very deliberate about using each others' time; friction can be a feature.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If I've piqued your interest, let's talk! I'm curious to learn more about the history and future of Cerebral. My email is <a class="blue"  href="mailto:hello@seriousness.nl" target="_blank">hello@seriousness.nl</a>.
