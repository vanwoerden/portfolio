        Expodium, an artist collective focusing on urban development was looking to share a publication with the world. Two artists had created a book about the urban status of Detroit after the financial crisis. They wanted to know how what they had seen in Detroit related to other urban areas in the world, by sending 20 copies of the book to 'urban experts' from all over the world and encouraging them to write a 'review' on the book. They also wanted the journeys of these books to be visible to the public, and create a location based ever growing archive of nodes of knowledge, connected by location.
