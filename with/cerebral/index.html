                Related experience in recruitment

            <p>
                From late 2017 to early 2020 I <a class="orange" href="../../#top20talent">led product design for Top20Talent</a>, a recruitment platform. If you think about it, there are some similarities between recruitment and healthcare:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    rigid protocols and workflows,
                </li>
                <li>
                    healthcare professionals (and HR) being forced to work with non-optimal tools and tech,
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    low visibility into the process for patients (and jobseekers),
                </li>
                <li>
                    the incentives for insurers/big pharma (and recruiters) to cut costs/make a profit,
                </li>
                <li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                ...just to name a few. Building solutions that somehow reconcile all of these opposing forces and misaligned incentives is hard. But it's also what makes design so interesting.

                To me, the more uncertain the idea, the more questions that need to be answered. It's just a matter of picking up the right set of tools from the toolbox. I tend to use any combination of interviews, quick experiments, prototypes, analytics, subject matter experts, previous research, competitor examples, and so on, in an incremental fashion.

                Ideally the findings can then be fed back into a model of the user, the market, and/or the business, so we don't have to start from scratch next time.

                Communicating clearly and convincingly is an essential skill for any designer, and even more so in remote setting with a lot of asynchronous communication.

                I've always been drawn to fiction and stories. I love how Neil Gaiman puts it, using Little Red Riding Hood: fiction uses a lie (a wolf pretending to be a grandmother) to tell you the truth (stranger danger).

                So now I'm reading Stephen King's <i>On Writing</i>, and watching Neil Gaiman and James Patterson on Masterclass to learn more about writing well, and I recently wrote about how <a class="green" href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-horror-of-usability-testing-1e74713dffaa" target="_blank">horror and usability testing are eerily similar</a>.

                I like picking up new skills and tools. When I wanted to figure out whether the air quality in Beijing was getting better over the long term, I learned just enough about D3.js to build a <a class="blue" href="https://aqi.fyi/beijing" target="_blank">visualization</a> (work in progress) that looked and worked close to the way I wanted it to.

                    Where I am now, I'm the only designer (and product manager). That means I work on a lot of different things. A principal design role would let me focus on design and still give me the ability to work on big picture ideas and detailed solutions. It seems like a natural fit for where I want to go.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What I'm currently missing, and what I think Cerebral could offer, is a team with more design peers and veterans. A team in which I could spread myself a little less thin, while still having a fair amount of impact and authority. A place where I could learn from, collaborate with, and help other designers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making a difference in peoples' lives gets me excited. It was a key reason for me to join Our World in Data, and Gather Health before that. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the past year and change, I've been part of a fully remote team, and it's been a breath of fresh air. I've done remote before—in fact, my <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A6cbfc59d-c29c-46e5-a705-465f71f9c310" target="_blank">master's thesis</a> explored remote collaboration—and I've always appreciated the ample amount of heads-down-get-the-work-done time, and that bit of extra flexibility. There are challenges, but I really like that as a remote team, you're forced to be very deliberate about using each others' time; friction can be a feature.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If I've piqued your interest, let's talk! I'm curious to learn more about the history and future of Cerebral. My email is <a class="blue"  href="mailto:hello@seriousness.nl" target="_blank">hello@seriousness.nl</a>.
