            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Our page on COVID-19 vaccinations was getting long. There were a lot of elements we thought were important, and moving them to the top of the page and/or emphasizing them were the main two ways to reflect that importance. But if everything's important, nothing is. On desktop, no actual data was visible without scrolling. On mobile, the distance to data was more than two screens. It was time for some adjustments.
            </p>
            <p>
                User interviews and usability testing confirmed that—especially for COVID-related pages—users expected to see data more quickly, and for a lot of them, anything else was getting in the way.

The Google search results page for <a class="code" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+vaccinations" target="_blank">COVID-19 vaccinations</a> puts data front and center. There's some space reserved for navigation, and a fraction of the screen is taken up by metadata.

            <p>
                The need for up-to-date data in our text was clear. We had been dreaming about using live data in our writing, but that was technically challenging to get right. Consider the following sentence:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="code">In 2000, the UK emitted 2.45 tons of coal per capita.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                When the underlying data changes, we could automatically update this to:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="code">In <b>2010</b>, the UK emitted <b>1.86</b> tons of coal per capita.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now imagine we add some context, for example: 
            
                <span class="code">In 2000, the UK emitted 2.45 tons of coal per capita—<i>0.59 tons more than China.</i></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our automatic update becomes tricky when China's emissions surpass those of the UK in 2004; a phrase like <span class="code"><i>that's very close to China</i></span> makes more sense for 2003, and after that it should be <span class="code"><i>less than China.</i></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                And since (global) progress is all about change over time, not being able to add this contextual layer to the writing would in many cases only be a partial solution for our authors. Big problems require a long-term view, looking at changes over years, decades, sometimes centuries, and organizations publishing data on these problems often do so only once a year.

                From December 1, 2020 to July 31, 2021, <span class="code"><b>64% of people</b></span> that visited our page on COVID-19 vaccinations were returning users. In the same period, the  percentage of returning users was <span class="code">53%</span> sitewide. Pre-pandemic—in 2019—that number sat at <span class="code">29%</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A much more active audience and a dataset that was updated daily made it appealing to go ahead with a form of live data in text. And we had proof that for active, returning visitors, not having to scroll down a page or two before getting to the meat, was important.

            <p>
                Based on the insights from user research and the data on returning visitors, I decided to put a few key stats on vaccinations right below the page title. That was a quick way that didn't require any dev effort; just some inline CSS to style the numbers to give them some extra attention, and a daily manual update for the time being.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also moved the “Our work belongs to everyone” block down below the data explorer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This then brought the data explorer in view on desktop, and at the very least, surfaced the key stats at the top of the page on mobile. In the end, having the authors' names prominently at the top was not as important as I had thought, and we just moved them to the bottom of the page.

                This was enough for us to move forward and implement a first version with automated live data at the top of the vaccinations page.

                Ultimately, the goal behind these changes is to get data closer to everyone who's interested in it. Especially to people who can use it to make decisions that affect real, long-term progress. Next steps to achieve this goal include:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Roll out this header with live data to many more parts of Our World in Data;
                </li>
                <li>
                    include visualizations in addition to text-only elements;
                </li>
                <li>
                    instead of improving our own tools, pages, and visualizations, pushing our data to other places and platforms (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+vaccinations" target="_blank">Google's SERPs already use it</a>, and we're experimenting with making our data and tools available in Jupyter notebooks);
                </li>
                <li>
                    chart thumbnails that accurately select author- or user-set parameters so both on-site and on social media, the chart that is shared contains accurate, up-to-date data;
                </li>
                <li>
                    exploring new ways of telling interactive stories with our data.

Now that we can use &quot;live&quot; data in our writing as well as in our charts, we can connect those two in many new and hopefully useful ways.
