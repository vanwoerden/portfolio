                You leave thinking wow, they have a lot of stuff in their collection. Maybe you realize not the whole collection is on display. But most of it is, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Nope. Many of the larger and more famous museums only display a single digit percentage of their complete collection. A few examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The British Museum has 1% of 2 million artworks on display. source
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Metropolitan Museum of Art: about 4% on display[3]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: 3% on display[4]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Philadelphia Museum of Art: about 4% on display[3]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Denver Art Museum: about 3% on display[3]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The British Museum has 1% on display.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are good reasons for this. Gallery space is limited. Light, temperature, and humidity all affect the lifespan of an artwork; optimal viewing and optimal conserving conditions are not the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, many museums started out eargerly growing their collection. Not much attention was paid to storage. Nor were most museums very discriminate about what art to accept and what to deny:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="likes" cite="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one#:~:text=Remember%3A%20when%20people%20tell%20you%20something%27s%20wrong%20or%20doesn%27t%20work%20for%20them%2C%20they%20are%20almost%20always%20right.%20When%20they%20tell%20you%20exactly%20what%20they%20think%20is%20wrong%20and%20how%C2%A0to%20fix%20it%2C%20they%20are%20almost%20always%20wrong.">
                ‚ÄúMuseums were accepting with less criticality when collections were smaller,‚Äù said James Rondeau, director of the Art Institute of Chicago. ‚ÄúWe took 12 when we might not have even taken one.‚Äù
            </blockquote>
            <p>As the number of artworks grew, so did the problem of conservation. Over time, the role of the museum changed from collector and exposer to conservator and keeper. But where is the balance between showing what you have vs preserving your collection for future generations? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Culturally, it's very much not done to cull collections. The name for it is telling: <i>deaccessioning</i>. Literally, the process of removing access. Yes, let's come up with a word to hide in plain sight what we want to do but we think is kind of not acceptable: GETTING RID OF PRISTINE PRECIOUS PUBLIC GOODS. Once you have the art, you're stuck with it. In the US, there are laws that prohibit (or lawsuits that are filed) museums from selling anything in their collection. 
            </p>
            <blockquote class="likes" cite="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one#:~:text=Remember%3A%20when%20people%20tell%20you%20something%27s%20wrong%20or%20doesn%27t%20work%20for%20them%2C%20they%20are%20almost%20always%20right.%20When%20they%20tell%20you%20exactly%20what%20they%20think%20is%20wrong%20and%20how%C2%A0to%20fix%20it%2C%20they%20are%20almost%20always%20wrong.">
                ‚ÄúAs Mr. Hoving found out, deaccessioning can sometimes be a dirty word. A routine practice, it is nonetheless often fraught with controversy. Won‚Äôt donors be insulted when museums re-gift or sell their donated work? Aren‚Äôt such gifts, underwritten by taxpayers, part of the public trust?.‚Äù

            <h2>Growing pains</h2>
            <p>
                The first iteration was a fully concrete post with directions on wooden slats affixed to it. Heavy and prone to vandalism. So in 1927, the ANWB piloted a version with a steel hood. Next, they got rid of the concrete underneath the hood, reducing the mushroom‚Äôs weight from 145 to 80kg. Nice. But the slanted sides remained vulnerable to cyclists' feet.
            </p>
            <h2>Who needs designers anyway</h2>
            <p>
                Interestingly, the ANWB held a design contest in 1942, asking its members for ideas. I have to assume this was before July of that year, because that's when the Germans started confiscating bicycles en mass‚Äîthe number of bicycles decreased from 4 to 2 million between 1940 and 1945. Still, there were 222 submissions. A popular suggestion was to get rid of the slanted sides and make them perpendicular. <i>That‚Äôll teach those who feel the need to put their feet on our beautiful mushrooms!</i> At this point I have to wonder whether the ANWB involved Leliman, the original designer, to evaluate this idea.

                The design of the ANWB Paddenstoel has withstood the test of time. That in itself is impressive. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It‚Äôs a weird mixture of helpful, friendly and harsh, brutalist. <i><q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture#:~:text=exposed%2C%20unpainted%20concrete%20or%20brick%2C%20angular%20geometric%20shapes">...exposed, unpainted¬†concrete¬†or¬†brick, angular¬†geometric¬†shapes</q></i> are trademarks of <a class="likes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture#:~:text=exposed%2C%20unpainted%20concrete%20or%20brick%2C%20angular%20geometric%20shapes" target="_blank">brutalist architecture</a>. The mushroom was designed by an architect. You can see where this is going: the Dutch architect J.W.H. Leliman was the father of brutalism, 30 years before it became a thing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you think that‚Äôs a stretch, just look at the Delft University of Technology auditorium, one of the pinnacles of brutalist architecture:
