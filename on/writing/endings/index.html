                <h2>
                    We need endings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a movie that depicts the same scene, over and over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A book that repeats itself, each chapter more predictable than the next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An article that makes the same point, page after page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are examples that can pull off a lack of narrative (I personally like Coffee and Cigarettes*), but they are rare, and they prove the rule: a good story needs an arc.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is literally a law of nature: as humans, we are hardwired for stories. Before we could draw and write, the only way to communicate ideas was to talk about them. And to make them "stick", we needed something worth remembering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compelling stories follow a narrative that roughly goes like this:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A character that we can identify with
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The character has a goal, but: <i>Obstacles</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conflict
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="yellow">Resolution: the goal is reached (or not)</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    And so, the arc of any great story bends towards an ending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Endings help us look forward
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chipping away at something without seeing progress is demotivating. 
                    If you can't see the end, you could be working on the thing for another day. Or a week. Or several months. There's no way to tell. Work in cycles, don't cut things up into parts that obscure the whole.
                </p>
                <h2>Agile, the big equalizer/Cut the shit</h2>
                <p>
                    **Ryan singer example** Agile is crap, nicely packaged

                    **Jeff patton tree example**
                    
                    Without seeing the whole, completing pieces of the puzzle becomes meaningless. The goal behind splitting up the work in manageable chunks makes sense, but too often the picture of the tree disappears and all that's left is a bunch of leaves and twigs.
                </p>
                <h2>If there's no end in sight...</h2>
                <p>
                    ... there's no reflection. How can we learn from our mistakes if there's no moment to look back? No ending also means no ability to plan long term. And if everything stays short term, we're just chipping away without a clear end in sight again. Not everything has to be planned out in detail, but without planning, we are in trouble. <br>
                    â†’ a surface level iteration is a dog chasing its tail. So agile, much pivot. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Estimates are hard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even if you take into account that the thing will always take more time than you thought, it's still take more time than you thought. Estimation is even harder early in the process. More uncertainty in the early stages of a project, so much harder to see the ending. But what if the only way to see the end is to dive in and start the work? When you just start to get things going, without defining a destination, you're quite literally going nowhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Continuous disappointment
                </h2>
                <p> If you set a really ambitious goal, but only achieve, say 65%, there's a good chance you'll still have  accomplished more than if you'd have set a normal aggression goal. But it also means you're never hitting your goals, which to me sounds rather disappointing. Not to mention disappointing your team, and your boss.
                
                **Stretch goals and realistic goals** If you can't tell how long the thing is going to take, there's no way to set a realistic goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even Groundhog Day has an ending.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * Some of the scenes in Coffee and Cigarettes do have a narrative, but that only underlines my point: can't escape the story arc.
