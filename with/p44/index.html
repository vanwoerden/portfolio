                About me
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm Ernst, a Dutch designer based in New York (LI). Over the past 11 years, I've worked in mostly in product, user experience, and interaction design, but also in  branding, motion design and animation. I've spent the majority of my time in-house at startups.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've explored working for myself, in agencies, and big tech in China, and I've found I'm happiest when I work on the product side of design.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                For designers to have true impact, end-to-end involvement in the product development process is crucial. I touch the full stack of design, from user research and product discovery to working with engineers to make sure designs come out as intended, and measuring the outcomes they are supposed to achieve. 
            </p> -->
            <p>
                I thrive in collaborative environments where we discover the best solution together, or find out where we’re wrong early on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently lead design for <a class="blue" href="../../#our-world-in-data">Our World in Data</a>, an online publication and set of data visualization tools that makes research and data on the world's biggest problems accessible, understandable, and usable.
            </p>
            <p>
                We work very incrementally, and my role as the only designer/product person encompasses user research, scoping features, lo-fi and hi-fi design and prototyping, usability testing, shaping the roadmap, guiding long-term strategy, and evaluating product performance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a great team of smart, dedicated, and thoughtful people, and the work is meaningful. But what I’m missing, and what I think Project44 could offer, is a team with more design peers and veterans. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A team in which I could spread myself a little less thin, while still having a fair amount of product and strategic impact through design. A place where I could learn from, collaborate with, and help other designers.

                Relevant background
            </p>
            <p>
                While I don't have experience working in the logistics industry, I believe some of my previous experience is directly relevant:
            </p>
            <p>
                I imagine providing a quick, high level overview of key supply chain data, combined with drilling down into details when necessary, is core to what Project44 does. This is what I work on at <a class="blue" href="../../#our-world-in-data">Our World in Data</a>: what are the key insights that people need to know about global problems and progress, and how does that break down into details that can be explored and compared?
            </p>
            <p>
                At <a class="orange" href="../../#top20talent">Top20Talent</a>, a big focus was workflow automation in the hiring process, including 1-click interview bookings from email, notifications, reminders, and robust syncing of process updates and data between a recruiter CRM with 500,000+ candidates, a client-facing recruitment web app, and a candidate-facing jobseeker and candidate referral product.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there's one thing I've learned: new, more efficient, automated workflows only work if the people that operate them are bought in. Designing for behavior change is incredibly hard—something I found out at <a class="green" href="../../#gather-health">Gather Health</a> too. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But when a design is able to take away a pain point in a cumbersome workflow, help someone understand a complex topic, or make an annoying, repetitive task obsolete entirely, it's very gratifying to see a happy face.

                            A side project where I explore if the air quality in Beijing is improving. The weather in Beijing is quite predictable. It's the air quality that determines whether it's a nice day to be outside or not. There are good and bad months throughout the year, but it's hard to tell if things are actually improving or not without looking at the data. (work in progress, view on desktop)
