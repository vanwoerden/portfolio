                    This is a story about the importance of endings in product design and development. Working without an ending, or without dynamics, a cadence, is terrible. Why? And how can we escape the drudge? THIS IS WORK ON PROGRESS THANKS FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING

                    We need endings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a movie that depicts the same scene, over and over.
                
                    A book that repeats itself, each chapter more predictable than the next.
                
                    An article that makes the same point, page after page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are movies that can pull off a lack of narrative (I personally like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBgJ7OrybVk" target="_blank">Coffee and Cigarettes</a>*), but they are rare, and they prove the rule: a good story needs an arc.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a law of nature: as humans, <a href="https://medium.com/the-protagonist/the-science-behind-storytelling-51169758b22c" target="_blank">we are hardwired for stories</a>. Before we could draw and write, the only way to communicate ideas was to talk about them. And to make ideas "stick", we needed something worth remembering: a story. With an arc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compelling stories follow a narrative that roughly goes like this:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Behold, a character that we can identify with
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The character has a goal, but: <i>Obstacles</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conflict
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="yellow">Resolution: our character overcomes the obstacles and reaches their goal (or not)</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    And so, the arc of any great story bends towards an ending. But somehow, we've ended up in a world where it's common to work without endings. What happened?
                </p>
                <h2>Where are we going?</h2>
                <p>
                    Without defining and agreeing on a destination, we don't know where we're going. A lot of work nowadays does not have a clear ending. <i>“Once we're happy with it, we can ship”.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what is happy? Where is North?
                </p>

                    Chipping away at something without seeing progress is demotivating. 
                    If you can't see the end, you could be working on the thing for another day. Or a week. Or several months. There's no way to tell when you'll be done. And soon, team motivation will drop.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Can't see the tree for the leaves</h2>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/">
                    <p>
                        “In my head I see a tree where the trunk is built from the goals or desired benefits that drive the system; big branches are users; the small branches and twigs are the capabilities they need; then finally the leaves are the user stories small enough to place into development iterations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all that work, after establishing all that shared understanding I feel like we pull all the leaves off the tree and load them into a leaf bag – then cut down the tree.

                    Without seeing the whole, completing pieces of the puzzle becomes meaningless. The goal behind splitting up the work in manageable chunks makes sense, but too often the picture of the tree disappears and all that's left is <a href="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/" target="_blank">a bunch of leaves.</a>
                </p>
                
                
                
                <h2>If there's no end in sight...</h2>
                <p>
                    ... there's no reflection. How can we learn from our mistakes if there's no moment to look back? No ending also means no ability to plan long term. And if everything stays short term, we're just chipping away without a clear end in sight again. Not everything has to be planned out in detail, but without planning, we are in trouble. <br>
                    → a surface level iteration is a dog chasing its tail. So agile, much pivot. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Estimates are hard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even if you take into account that the thing will always take more time than you thought, it's still take more time than you thought. Estimation is even harder early in the process. More uncertainty in the early stages of a project, so much harder to see the ending. But what if the only way to see the end is to dive in and start the work? When you just start to get things going, without defining a destination, you're quite literally going nowhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Continuous disappointment
                </h2>
                <p> If you set a really ambitious goal, but only achieve, say 65%, there's a good chance you'll still have  accomplished more than if you'd have set a normal aggression goal. But it also means you're never hitting your goals, which to me sounds rather disappointing. Not to mention disappointing your team, and your boss.
                
                **Stretch goals and realistic goals** If you can't tell how long the thing is going to take, there's no way to set a realistic goal.
