                <h2>
                    We need endings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a movie without a story arc: the same scene, over and over. Imagine a book that repeats itself, every chapter more predictable than the next. An article that makes the same point, page after page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are exceptional movies that make this work, but they are rare, and prove the rule: a good story needs an arc. And a story arc bends towards an ending. Books have story arcs. Musics have story arcs.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    People need closure. People need variety. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good ending != a happy ending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Endings help us look forward
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chipping away at something without seeing progress is demotivating. 
                    If you can't see the end, you could be working on the thing for another day. Or a week. Or several months. There's no way to tell. Work in cycles, don't cut things up into parts that obscure the whole.
                </p>
                <h2>If there's no end in sight...</h2>
                <p>
                    ... there's no reflection. How can we learn from our mistakes if there's no moment to look back? No ending also means no ability to plan long term. And if everything stays short term, we're just chipping away without a clear end in sight again. Not everything has to be planned out in detail, but without planning, we are in trouble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Estimates are hard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even if you take into account that the thing will always take more time than you thought, it's still take more time than you thought. Estimation is even harder early in the process. More uncertainty in the early stages of a project, so much harder to see the ending. But what if the only way to see the end is to dive in and start the work? When you just start to get things going, without defining a destination, you're quite literally going nowhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Continuous disappointment
                </h2>
                <p> If you set a really ambitious goal, but only achieve, say 65%, there's a good chance you'll still have  accomplished more than if you'd have set a normal aggression goal. But it also means you're never hitting your goals, which to me sounds rather disappointing. Not to mention disappointing your team, and your boss.
                
                **Stretch goals and realistic goals** If you can't tell how long the thing is going to take, there's no way to set a realistic goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even Groundhog Day has an ending.
