                We need endings
            </h2>
            <p>
                Imagine a movie that depicts the same scene, over and over.
            
                A book that repeats itself, each chapter more predictable than the next.
            
                An article that makes the same point, page after page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Movies that can pull off a lack of narrative (I personally like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBgJ7OrybVk" target="_blank">Coffee and Cigarettes</a>*) are rare, and they prove the rule: a good story needs an arc.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a law of nature: as humans, <a href="https://medium.com/the-protagonist/the-science-behind-storytelling-51169758b22c" target="_blank">we are hardwired for stories</a>. Before we could draw and write, the only way to communicate ideas was to talk about them. And to make ideas "stick", we needed something worth remembering: a story. With an arc.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Compelling stories follow a narrative that roughly goes like this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A <span class="yellow">character</span> that we can identify with is introduced
                </li>
                <li>
                    The character has a <span class="yellow">goal</span>, but: <span class="yellow">Obstacles</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="yellow">Conflict</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="yellow">Resolution:</span> our character overcomes the obstacles and reaches their goal (or not)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The end
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Without seeing the whole, completing pieces of the puzzle becomes meaningless. The goal behind splitting up the work in manageable chunks makes sense, but too often the picture of the tree disappears and all that's left is <a href="https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/" target="_blank">a bunch of leaves.</a>

                <p>
                    After all that work, after establishing all that shared understanding I feel like we pull all the leaves off the tree and load them into a leaf bag – then cut down the tree.

            <h2>[unstructured notes from this point] If there's no end in sight...</h2>
            <p>
                ... there's no reflection. How can we learn from our mistakes if there's no moment to look back? No ending also means no ability to plan long term. And if everything stays short term, we're just chipping away without a clear end in sight again. Not everything has to be planned out in detail, but without planning, we are in trouble. <br>
                → a surface level iteration is a dog chasing its tail. So agile, much pivot.

                Estimates are hard
            </h2>
            <p>
                Even if you take into account that the thing will always take more time than you thought, it's still take more time than you thought. Estimation is even harder early in the process. More uncertainty in the early stages of a project, so much harder to see the ending. But what if the only way to see the end is to dive in and start the work? When you just start to get things going, without defining a destination, you're quite literally going nowhere.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Continuous disappointment
            </h2>
            <p> If you set a really ambitious goal, but only achieve, say 65%, there's a good chance you'll still have  accomplished more than if you'd have set a normal aggression goal. But it also means you're never hitting your goals, which to me sounds rather disappointing. Not to mention disappointing your team, and your boss.
            
            **Stretch goals and realistic goals** If you can't tell how long the thing is going to take, there's no way to set a realistic goal.
