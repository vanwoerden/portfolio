There was a 2020 EU court ruling that said so but now the Austrian govt has basically said they will enfore this Schrems II ruling. <\/p><p>There are two rules. If the US govt has a way to make the company that owns the servers comply and handover data, it's illegal.<\/p><p>Fathom is one of the few website analytics providers that is above board. They explain more in this blog post and this podcast episode. They even made a tool that scans your website and tells you whether your website analytics are kosher. Pretty neat, right?<\/p>"},"id":"05473c53-831a-4ba8-ba3e-cfada298a298","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
