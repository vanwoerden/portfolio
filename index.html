                                        A lot of businesses, especially startups, have great ideas but struggle to communicate them clearly. They would come to us for help. Under the banner of Studio Tony, I made lots of <a class="orange" href="nhlo.html">short explainer videos</a> and animations.

                                        This was an interesting combination of working for insurance companies and pharmaceuticals, while trying to design user-friendly products and services. Bringing together competing incentives in a heavily regulated (and thus risk-averse, often not exactly on the cutting edge) industry, was challenging.

                                        A friend translated my first name into English. That day, Seriousness was born. I started out designing and building websites in Flash. These days, I focus on the designs, and work with developers for implementation.
